We’re in the running for an award, courtesy of the B2B Marketing Awards where we’ve been shortlisted in the Best Brand Initiative category for our rebranding and corporate ID work for Arcserve.

Now, some agencies can be very sniffy about industry awards, dismissing them as self-elevated, back-slapping exercises and not much more. And some other agencies won’t take on new clients unless they think there’s an award-winning piece of work to be had from it. Sounds bizarre? Well, it’s true.

At Enigma we’ve never really gone out of our way to win awards. But that’s not because we think we’re in any way above the whole business. Far from it, in fact, and this year we decided to enter a few projects into select industry awards, which is why we’re really pleased to have been shortlisted.

We’re especially pleased because we’re really proud of the [rebrand work we did with Arcserve](/).

When Arcserve was divested from CA, it needed a whole new visual identity, one that exuded simplicity, trust and effectiveness, in order to secure the interest and support of new investors and backers.

Not only did we produce work that we are very proud of from a creative perspective, we also worked in a truly collaborative way with the client, as one team – an approach that really helped speed up decisions, remove unproductive admin, and get to the heart of what was needed fast.

> &ldquo;To be able to see genuine financial benefits from the project – in terms of savings in time and cost with regard to UDP, and the subsequent excellent sales growth we’ve seen&rdquo;

The results of the project were seen not just in the new visual identity for Arcserve, but were apparent in a commercially tangible way too, thanks to the way we were able to contribute to re-engineering Arcserve’s flagship product.
